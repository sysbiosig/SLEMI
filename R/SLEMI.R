#' Statistical Learning based Estimation of Mutual Information (SLEMI). A package for estimating mutual information and channel capacity from experimental data.
#'
#' The package SLEMI is designed to estimate channel capacity between finite 
#' state input and multidimensional continuouse output from experimental data. For efficient computations, 
#' it uses an iterative algorithm based on logistic regression. In addition, functions to estimate mutual information and
#' calculate probabilities of correct discrimination between a pair of input values are implemented.
