\title{Plotting output of capacity estimation and additional exploratory graphs.}
\usage{
output_graphs_main(data, signal, response, side_variables, cc_output,
  output_path, height = 4, width = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is a data.frame object}

\item{signal}{is a character object that indicates columns of data that should be treated as channel's input}

\item{response}{is a character vector that indicates columns of data that should be treated as channel's output}

\item{side_variables}{is a character vector that indicates side variables' columns of data}

\item{cc_output}{a list that is a standard output of capacity_logreg_algorithm function}

\item{height}{integer indicating the height of a single plot}

\item{width}{integer indicating the width of a single plot}

\item{path}{character giving the directory, where graphs should be saved}
}
\value{
A list with ggplot or gtable object. Each plot is also saved in `output_path` directory in separate pdfs files which include:
\itemize{
\item MainPlot.pdf - a simple summary plot with basic distribution visualization and capacity estimate
\item MainPlot_full.pdf - a comprehensive summary plot with distribution visualization and capacity estimate
\item capacity.pdf - a diagram presenting the capacity estimates
\item io_relation.pdf - a graph with input-output relation
\item kdensities.pdf - kernel density estimator of data distribution
\item histograms.pdf - histograms of data
\item boxplots.pdf - boxplots of data
\item violin.pdf - violin plots of data
