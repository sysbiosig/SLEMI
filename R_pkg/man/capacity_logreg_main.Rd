\description{
The main wrapping function for basic usage of SLEMI package for estimation of channel capacity. Firstly, data is pre-processed
(all arguments are checked, observation with NAs are removed, variables are scaled and centered (if scale=TRUE)). Then basic estimation is carried out
and (if testing=TRUE) diagnostic tests are computed. If output directory path is given (output_path is not NULL), graphs visualising the data and the analysis
are saved there, together with a compressed output object (as .rds file) with full estimation results.

\details{
In a typical experiment aimed to quantify information flow a given signaling system, input values \eqn{x_1\leq x_2 \ldots... \leq x_m}, ranging from 0 to saturation are considered.
Then, for each input level, \eqn{x_i}, \eqn{n_i} observations are collected, which are represetned as vectors 
\deqn{y^i_j \sim P(Y|X = x_i)}
Within information theory the degree of information transmission is measured as the mutual information
\deqn{MI(X,Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(x_i)\int_{R^k} P(y|X = x_i)log_2\frac{P(y|X = x_i)}{P(y)}dy,}
where \eqn{P(y)} is the marginal distribution of the output. MI is expressed in bits and \eqn{2^{MI}} can be interpreted as the number of 
inputs that the system can resolve on average.

The maximization of mutual information with respect to the input distribution, \eqn{P(X)},
defines the information capacity, C. Formally,
\deqn{C^* = max_{P(X)} MI(X,Y)}
Information capacity is expressed in bits and \eqn{2^{C^*}} can be interpreted as the maximal number of inputs that the system can
effectively resolve.

In contrast to existing approaches, instead of estimating, possibly highly dimensional, conditional output distributions P(Y|X =x_i), we propose to estimate the discrete, conditional input distribution, 
\eqn{P(x_i |Y = y)}, which is known to be a simpler problem. Estimation of the MI using estimates of \eqn{P(x_i |Y = y)}, denoted here as \eqn{\hat{P}(x_i|Y = y)}, is possible as the MI, can be
alternatively written as
\deqn{MI(X,Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(x_i)\int_{R^k} P(y|X = x_i)log_2\frac{P(x_i|Y = y)}{P(x_i)}dy}
The expected value (as in above expression) with respect to distribution \eqn{P(Y|X = x_i)} can be approximated by the average with respect to data
\deqn{MI(X,Y) \approx \sum_{i=1}^{m} P(x_i)\frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i} P(y|X = x_i)log_2\frac{\hat{P}(x_i|Y = y^i_j)}{P(x_i)}dy}
Here, we propose to use logistic regression as \eqn{\hat{P}(x_i|Y = y^i_j)}. Specifically,
\deqn{log\frac{P(x_i |Y = y)}{P(x_m|Y = y)} \approx \alpha_i +\beta_iy}

Following this approach, channel capacity can be calculated by optimising MI with respect to the input distribution, \eqn{P(X)}.
However, this, potentially difficult problem, can be divided into two simpler maximization problems, for which explicit solutions exist. 
Therefore, channel capacity can be obtained from the two explicit solutions in an iterative procedure known as alternate maximization (similarly as in Blahut-Arimoto algorithm) [1].

Additional parameters: lr_maxit and maxNWts are the same as in definition of multinom function from nnet package. An alternative
model formula (using formula_string arguments) should be provided if  data are not suitable for description by logistic regression
(recommended only for advanced users). Preliminary scaling of  data (argument scale) should be used similarly as in other 
data-driven approaches, e.g. if response variables are comparable, scaling (scale=FALSE) can be omitted, while if they represent 
different phenomenon (varying by units and/or magnitude) scaling is recommended.
