\description{
In the paper describing methodological aspects of our algorithm we present the analysis of information transmission 
in NfkB pathway upn the stimulation of TNF-\eqn{\alpha}. Experimental data from this experiment in the form of single-cell 
time series are attached to the package as a data.frame object and can be accessed using `data_nfkb` variable.
Each row of `data_nfkb` represents a single observation of a cell. Column 'signal' indicates the level of TNF-\eqn{\alpha}
stimulation for a given cell, while columns 'response_T', gives the normalised ratio of nuclear and cytoplasmic transcription 
factor as described in Supplementary Methods of the corresponding publication. In the CRAN version of the package
we included only a subset of the data (5 time measurements). For the full datasets, please access GitHub pages.
}
\details{
For each concentration, there are at least 1000 single-cell observation (with the exception of 0.5ng stimulation, 
where the number of identified cells is almost 900)
