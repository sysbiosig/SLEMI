\title{Statistical Learning based Estimation of Mutual Information (SLEMI). A package for estimating mutual information and channel capacity from experimental data.}
\description{
The package SLEMI is designed to estimate channel capacity between finite 
state input and multidimensional continuouse output from experimental data. For efficient computations, 
it uses an iterative algorithm based on logistic regression. In addition, functions to estimate mutual information and
calculate probabilities of correct discrimination between a pair of input values are implemented.
