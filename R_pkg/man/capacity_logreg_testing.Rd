\usage{
capacity_logreg_testing(data, signal = "signal", response = "response",
  side_variables = NULL, cc_maxit = 100, lr_maxit = 1000,
  MaxNWts = 5000, formula_string = NULL, TestingSeed = 1234,
  testing_cores = 1, boot_num = 10, boot_prob = 0.8,
  sidevar_num = 10, traintest_num = 10, partition_trainfrac = 0.6)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{must be a data.frame object. Cannot contain NA values.}

\item{signal}{is a character object with names of columns of dataRaw to be treated as channel's input.}

\item{response}{is a character vector with names of columns of dataRaw  to be treated as channel's output}

\item{side_variables}{(optional) is a character vector that indicates side variables' columns of data, if NULL no side variables are included}

\item{cc_maxit}{is the number of iteration of iterative optimisation of the algorithm to esimate channel capacity. Default is 100.}

\item{lr_maxit}{is a maximum number of iteration of fitting algorithm of logistic regression. Default is 1000.}

\item{formula_string}{(optional) is a character object that includes a formula syntax to use in logistic regression model. 
If NULL, a standard additive model of response variables is assumed. Only for advanced users.}

\item{TestingSeed}{is the seed for random number generator used in testing procedures}

\item{testing_cores}{- number of cores to be used in parallel computing (via doParallel package)}

\item{boot_num}{is the number of bootstrap tests to be performed. Default is 10, but it is recommended to use at least 50 for reliable estimates.}

\item{boot_prob}{is the proportion of initial size of data to be used in bootstrap. Default is 0.8.}

\item{sidevar_num}{is the number of re-shuffling tests of side variables to be performed. Default is 10, but it is recommended to use at least 50 for reliable estimates.}

\item{traintest_num}{is the number of overfitting tests to be performed. Default is 10, but it is recommended to use at least 50 for reliable estimates.}

\item{partition_trainfrac}{is the fraction of data to be used as a training dataset. Default is 0.6.}

\item{maxNWts}{is a maximum acceptable number of weights in logistic regression algorithm. Default is 5000.}

\value{
a list with four elements:
\itemize{
\item output$bootstrap - confusion matrix of logistic regression predictions
\item output$resamplingMorph          - channel capacity in bits
\item output$traintest      - optimal probability distribution
\item output$bootResampMorph      - nnet object describing logistic regression model (if model_out=TRUE)
}
Each of above is a list, where an element is an output of a single repetition of the channel capacity algorithm
}
\description{
Diagnostic procedures that allows to compute the uncertainity of estimation of channel capacity by SLEMI approach. Two main procedures are implemented:
bootstrap, which execute estimation with using a fraction of data and overfitting test, which dividies data into two parts: training and testing. Each of them
is repeated specified number of times to obtain a distribution of our estimators. It is recommended to conduct estimation by calling capacity_logreg_main.R.
}
\details{
If side variables are added within the analysis (side_variables is not NULL), two additional procedures are carried out:
reshuffling test and reshuffling with boostrap test, which are based on permutation of side variables values within the dataset.  
Additional parameters: lr_maxit and maxNWts are the same as in definition of multinom function from nnet package. An alternative
model formula (using formula_string arguments) should be provided if  data are not suitable for description by logistic regression
(recommended only for advanced users).
